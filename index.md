##### Welcome!

Thanks for visiting my website!
I am currently a student at Los Alamos High School, and have competed in science fairs and other competitions for the past three years. Last year, I placed third at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. I love analyzing big datasets to answer big questions about climate, society, and their interactions. To see more about my projects, check out my other pages!
