Lillian Petersen analyzes large data sets to answer socially relevant questions. Her research topics include real-time prediction of crops, the effects of climate change on crop yields, climate means and extremes in observational data, tracking deforestation, and weather correlations with El Nino. She pulls her data from historical weather observations, crop yields, climate model data, and satellite imagery, and conducts computations with python on the Google Cloud.
