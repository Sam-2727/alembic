Lillian Petersen analyzes large data sets to answer socially relevant questions. After learning how to computer program in fifth grade, she decided to use these skills to research climate change and further international aid. Motivated to help those without sufficient food, Lillian has created a real-time monitoring system to predict crop yeilds 3--4 months before the harvest in every African country. Later, she expanded this crop monitoring tool to predict malnutrition across large areas at high resolution. These tools could enable timely procurement of malnutrition treatment.
