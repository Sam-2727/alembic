Lillian Petersen analyzes large data sets to answer socially relevant questions. After learning how to computer program in fifth grade, she decided to use her skills to research climate change and international aid. Motivated to help those without sufficient food, Lillian created a real-time monitoring system to predict crop yeilds 3-4 months before the harvest in every African country. Later, she expanded this crop monitoring tool to predict malnutrition across large areas at high resolution. These tools could enable timely procurement of malnutrition treatment.

Lillian is currently a Senior at Los Alamos High School in New Mexico. She has taken 10 AP classes (Biology, Chemistry, Calculus-based Physics, Environmental Sciences, Calculus 1 and 2, Statistics, German, English Language, English Literature, and US History) and maintains a 4.0 unweighted GPA. She is also a violin teacher for children and enjoys running and playing racquetball in her freetime. She is currently interning at the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences in San Diego, California, where she is exploring how gene activation is related to Leukemia.
