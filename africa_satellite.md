### Abstract

Developing countries often have poor monitoring and reporting of weather and crop health, leading to slow response to droughts and food shortages. Here, new satellite data analysis tools were created to monitor crop health in Africa. The method was first tested in Illinois where there is reliable, high-resolution crop data. Measures of crop health, including NDVI, EVI, and NDWI, were computed from 120-meter resolution MODIS satellite imagery since 2000. Correlations were computed between corn yields and monthly satellite index anomalies for every county and year, and a multivariate regression using every index and month produced a correlation of 0.86. The high correlations in Illinois show that this model has good forecasting skill for crop yields. Next, the method was applied to three countries in Africa: Ethiopia, Tunisia, and Morocco for each countryâ€™s main crop. All three countries had high correlations with maximum NDVI during the rainy season, ranging from 0.73 to 0.99. The satellite analysis methods and software tools developed here can be used to predict crop production two to four months before the harvest, and many more months before official crop data is published. Next, satellite imagery was processed for every African country, and a publicly viewable interactive map displaying the relative plant health was posted online. This early warning system can be used to give governments and aid organizations advance warning of impending food shortages in order to prevent famines in developing countries.
